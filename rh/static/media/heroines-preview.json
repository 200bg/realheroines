She found herself having visions of angels and saints advising her to be virtuous and go to church regularly. But it wasn\u2019t until she turned 12 that Joan claimed the Archangel Michael came to her and said she needed to go to France, take the city of Orl\u00e9ans back from the English, and restore France to Charles VII. Four years later, the 16 year old obeyed her visions and started her quest.\nMany did not believe her mission, but they were desperate for help.

Over the next few months other victories were to follow, and Joan delivered the crown to Charles VII.\nAfter the coronation Joan aimed to recapture Paris from the English. She was devoted to the people of France and wanted to help them escape. However, the lack of support from Charles VII, insufficient funds, a dwindling amount of supplies, and over confidence from French troops caused things to take a downward spiral. She no longer claimed any victories, and was eventually captured. \nIn 1431 the clergy at the University of Paris, which was pro-English, interrogated Joan of Arc. For fear of creating a martyr for the French they did not execute her immediately. She was imprisoned for months in a prison supervised by men where she faced constant threat of rape. Joan was unjustly charged for heresy, denied a legal adviser, and judged by an unbiased court who was politically motivated. \nAfter the Hundred Years\u2019 War ended there was a retrial to investigate Joan of Arc\u2019s execution. In 1456 she was found innocent, and made a saint in 1920 by Pope Benedict XV. Her bravery, leadership, and devotion to the French people contributed to their escape from the English for some time.
